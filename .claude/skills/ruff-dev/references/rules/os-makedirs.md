Derived from the **[flake8-use-pathlib](../#flake8-use-pathlib-pth)** linter.

Fix is sometimes available.

## [What it does](#what-it-does)

Checks for uses of `os.makedirs`.

## [Why is this bad?](#why-is-this-bad)

`pathlib` offers a high-level API for path manipulation, as compared to
the lower-level API offered by `os`. When possible, using `Path` object
methods such as `Path.mkdir(parents=True)` can improve readability over the
`os` module's counterparts (e.g., `os.makedirs()`.

## [Examples](#examples)

```
import os

os.makedirs("./nested/directory/")
```

Use instead:

```
from pathlib import Path

Path("./nested/directory/").mkdir(parents=True)
```

## [Known issues](#known-issues)

While using `pathlib` can improve the readability and type safety of your code,
it can be less performant than the lower-level alternatives that work directly with strings,
especially on older versions of Python.

## [Fix Safety](#fix-safety)

This rule's fix is marked as unsafe if the replacement would remove comments attached to the original expression.
