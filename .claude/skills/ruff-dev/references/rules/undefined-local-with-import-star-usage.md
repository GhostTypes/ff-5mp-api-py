## [What it does](#what-it-does)

Checks for names that might be undefined, but may also be defined in a
wildcard import.

## [Why is this bad?](#why-is-this-bad)

Wildcard imports (e.g., `from module import *`) make it hard to determine
which symbols are available in the current namespace. If a module contains
a wildcard import, and a name in the current namespace has not been
explicitly defined or imported, then it's unclear whether the name is
undefined or was imported by the wildcard import.

If the name *is* defined in via a wildcard import, that member should be
imported explicitly to avoid confusion.

If the name is *not* defined in a wildcard import, it should be defined or
imported.

## [Example](#example)

```
from math import *


def area(radius):
    return pi * radius**2
```

Use instead:

```
from math import pi


def area(radius):
    return pi * radius**2
```
